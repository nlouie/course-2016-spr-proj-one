Description:
In this project I'm focused on individual earning reports in three continous years.
By compare the total earnings each year and the number of person who has increasing total earnings in three years, we can find 
out the percentage of people who earns more and more each year and the tile and departments of these peoples.

To finish this, I go through three collections and looking for data that has same name. Than I merge all three collections and 
put total earnings of three years in a same collection.

For the second part, I go through all three collections and looks for people who have increasing total earning each year and  
only keep these data.

Then we calculate the percentage of people who have increasing earnings each year with the number of items of frist script and
the number of items of second script.
