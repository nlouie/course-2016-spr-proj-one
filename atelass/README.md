The three datasets being used in this project, all from the city of Boston, are Crime Incident Reports (2012-2015), Streetlight Locations, and MBTA T Stops by Location. The idea behind combining these datasets is to characterize the relative safety of different T stops at night. Ideally, one would assume that the more streetlights there are in a given location, the less likely a crime would occur. As such, when we characterize the safety of these stops at night, we can examine our results to see if this assumption is true or not.
Note on credentials: only an API key for the MBTA data is necessary, as I was able to collect the other data without authentication.
